Your task is to annotate the explanations, add start_line and end_line attributes to the dictionaries.

The original json is a list of dictionaries, where each dict should contains:
file_path: The file being explained.
explanatory_text: A brief, high-level explanation of what that part of the code is doing.

start_line and end_line represent the code the explanation is talking about, in the file_path.

start_line: The line number where the explanation starts.
end_line: The line number where explanation ends (so as if you are highlighting this part from line to endline)

Note that general explanations with no focus on a specific part of the file, have start_line and end_line set to 0.
Note that the maximum allowed highlight is {max_highlight}
Output the full json with the new attributes added.


Here is the json containing explanations:
{explanations}


Here is the codebase the json is trying to explain:
{codebase}
