I will provide you with a codebase, and I want you to generate a high-level explanation of how the project flows and how each component contributes to the process. However, instead of giving a one long explanation, I want you to present it as an ordered list of dict objects.

Each dict should contain:
file_path: The file being explained.
line: The line number where the explanation starts.
explanatory_text: A brief, high-level explanation of what that part of the code is doing.

You should act as a storyteller walking me through the project as if I were exploring it for the first time. Assume I'm already familiar with Python, so don’t explain basic concepts or code details. Instead, focus on how the different parts fit together.

Keep the tone engaging and natural, as if you're guiding me through the project. Don't go into unnecessary details—just introduce each section, explain its role, and move on.

Keep it short and concise in general, don't write more than 25 explanations. write only between 10 to 25 depending on the project size and complexity.

At the end, I should have a clear understanding of the project's workflow without having to read the entire codebase myself.

Here is the codebase:
